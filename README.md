Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI:
-----------------------------------

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically. Built with React, Material-UI, and a mock API, this application emphasizes security, flexibility, and user experience.

Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

RBAC Specific Commands
In addition to the standard Create React App scripts, we have added some RBAC-specific features:

User Management:
---------------
Navigate to the Users tab.
You can Add, Edit, or Delete users.
Assign or modify roles by selecting from available role options.
Role Management

Navigate to the Roles tab.
Add, Edit, or Delete roles as needed.
Assign permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to roles.

Permissions Management:
----------------------
Navigate to the Permissions tab.
Here, administrators can manage dynamic permissions for roles.
Modify permissions as required (Read, Write, Delete) for better control.
Available Scripts for the RBAC UI

In the project directory, you can run:

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
This is useful for running unit tests related to the RBAC functionality.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include the hashes.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Deployment Instructions:
-----------------------
Build the Project

Run:
npm run build

Deploy the build directory

You can deploy your application on static hosting platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
